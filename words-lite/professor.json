He is the clever but evil enemy of Sherlock Holmes. In a story published in 1894 both of them fall to their deaths after a fight on a cliff path, though Conan Doyle later brought Holmes 'back to life' by writing that he had survived the fall. This was because the public was so keen for more Holmes stories."}
